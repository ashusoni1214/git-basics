Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files and collaborate with others.
It is used to manage the history of your code and to merge changes from different branches. 

**Git and GitHub are not the same**

Git is a version control system used to track changes in files. It is a free, open-source software that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Since Git is software, you can install it on your local machine.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows developers to store, share, and collaborate on code projects. While GitHub is one of the most popular hosting services for Git repositories, it is not the only one—other platforms like GitLab and Bitbucket also offer similar functionality.

**Why Should You Learn Git?**


Even if you’re not a programmer, Git can help in:

✅ Tracking changes in reports, documents, and code.

✅ Collaborating with others without losing previous versions.

✅ Undoing mistakes by rolling back to an earlier version.


**A little on version control systems**

Version control systems are used to manage the history of your code. They allow you to track changes to your files and to collaborate with others. Version control systems are essential for software development. Consider version control as a checkpoint in game. You can move to any time in the game and you can always go back to the previous checkpoint. This is the same concept in software development.

Before Git became mainstream, version control systems were used by developers to manage their code. They were called SCCS (Source Code Control System). SCCS was a proprietary software that was used to manage the history of code. It was expensive and not very user-friendly. Git was created to replace SCCS and to make version control more accessible and user-friendly. Some commong version control systems are Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.

**Install Git**
To install Git, you can use command line or you can visit official website and download the installer for your operating system. Git is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux and is available at https://git-scm.com/downloads.

**Account on Github**
Another step that you have to follow is to create an account on Github. I will later walk you through the process of linking your Github account with your Machine. You cannot push your code to Github without ssh-key setup. Password authentication is not recommended and these days it is not possible to use it. So, you need to setup ssh-key authentication.
